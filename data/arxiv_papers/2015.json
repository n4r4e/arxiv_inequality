    "abstract": "With the advent of online networks, societies are substantially more\nconnected with individual members able to easily modify and maintain their own\nsocial links. Here, we show that active network maintenance exposes agents to\nconfirmation bias, the tendency to confirm one's beliefs, and we explore how\nthis affects collective opinion formation. We introduce a model of binary\nopinion dynamics on a complex network with fast, stochastic rewiring and show\nthat confirmation bias induces a segregation of individuals with different\nopinions. We use the dynamics of global opinion to generally categorize opinion\nupdate rules and find that confirmation bias always stabilizes the consensus\nstate. Finally, we show that the time to reach consensus has a non-monotonic\ndependence on the magnitude of the bias, suggesting a novel avenue for\nlarge-scale opinion engineering.",

This paper presents SMART, a\nSoftware-Defined Networking (SDN) middlebox architecture for reliable\ntransfers. As an architectural enhancement for network flows allocation,\nrouting, and control, SMART ensures timely delivery of flows by diverting them\nto a less congested path dynamically in the software-defined data center\nnetworks. SMART also clones packets of higher priority flows to route in an\nalternative path, along with the original flow. Hence SMART offers a\ndifferentiated QoS through varying levels of redundancy in the flows.",

The Social Well Being Index (SWBI) and its components are\nproposed through to an innovative technique of supervised sentiment analysis\ncalled iSA which scales to any language and big data. As main methodological\nadvantages, this approach can estimate several aspects of social well being\ndirectly from self-declared perceptions, instead of approximating it through\nobjective (but partial) quantitative variables like GDP; moreover\nself-perceptions of welfare are spontaneous and not obtained as answers to\nexplicit questions that are proved to bias the result. As an application we\nevaluate the SWBI in Italy through the period 2012-2015 through the analysis of\nmore than 143 millions of tweets.",

    "abstract": "This paper considers trial-offer markets where consumer preferences are\nmodeled by a multinomial logit with social influence and position bias. The\nsocial signal for a product is given by its current market share raised to\npower r (or equivalently the number of purchases raised to the power of r). The\npaper shows that, when r is strictly between 0 and 1, and a static position\nassignment (e.g., a quality ranking) is used, the market converges to a unique\nequilibrium where the market shares depend only on product quality, not their\ninitial appeals or the early dynamics. When r is greater than 1, the market\nbecomes unpredictable. In many cases, the market goes to a monopoly for some\nproduct: Which product becomes a monopoly depends on the initial conditions of\nthe market. These theoretical results are complemented by an agent-based\nsimulation which indicates that convergence is fast when r is between 0 and 1,\nand that the quality ranking dominates the well-known popularity ranking in\nterms of market efficiency. These results shed a new light on the role of\nsocial influence which is often blamed for unpredictability, inequalities, and\ninefficiencies in markets. In contrast, this paper shows that, with a proper\nsocial signal and position assignment for the products, the market becomes\npredictable, and inequalities and inefficiencies can be controlled\nappropriately.",

Examples of such annotations include image tags and\nkeywords found on photo sharing sites, or in datasets containing image\ncaptions. In this paper, we use these noisy annotations for learning visually\ncorrect image classifiers. Such annotations do not use consistent vocabulary,\nand miss a significant amount of the information present in an image; however,\nwe demonstrate that the noise in these annotations exhibits structure and can\nbe modeled. We propose an algorithm to decouple the human reporting bias from\nthe correct visually grounded labels. Our results are highly interpretable for\nreporting \"what's in the image\" versus \"what's worth saying.\" We demonstrate\nthe algorithm's efficacy along a variety of metrics and datasets, including MS\nCOCO and Yahoo Flickr 100M.

    "abstract": "Diffusion weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MR) is a powerful tool in\nimaging-based prostate cancer screening and detection. Endorectal coils are\ncommonly used in DW-MR imaging to improve the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of\nthe acquisition, at the expense of significant intensity inhomogeneities (bias\nfield) that worsens as we move away from the endorectal coil. The presence of\nbias field can have a significant negative impact on the accuracy of different\nimage analysis tasks, as well as prostate tumor localization, thus leading to\nincreased inter- and intra-observer variability. Retrospective bias correction\napproaches are introduced as a more efficient way of bias correction compared\nto the prospective methods such that they correct for both of the scanner and\nanatomy-related bias fields in MR imaging. Previously proposed retrospective\nbias field correction methods suffer from undesired noise amplification that\ncan reduce the quality of bias-corrected DW-MR image. Here, we propose a\nunified data reconstruction approach that enables joint compensation of bias\nfield as well as data noise in DW-MR imaging. The proposed noise-compensated,\nbias-corrected (NCBC) data reconstruction method takes advantage of a novel\nstochastically fully connected joint conditional random field (SFC-JCRF) model\nto mitigate the effects of data noise and bias field in the reconstructed MR\ndata. The proposed NCBC reconstruction method was tested on synthetic DW-MR\ndata, physical DW-phantom as well as real DW-MR data all acquired using\nendorectal MR coil. Both qualitative and quantitative analysis illustrated that\nthe proposed NCBC method can achieve improved image quality when compared to\nother tested bias correction methods. As such, the proposed NCBC method may\nhave potential as a useful retrospective approach for improving the consistency\nof image interpretations.",

We address this problem by introducing supervision via\nthe loss function of autoencoders. In particular, we first train a linear\nclassifier on the labeled data, then define a loss for the autoencoder with the\nweights learned from the linear classifier. To reduce the bias brought by one\nsingle classifier, we define a posterior probability distribution on the\nweights of the classifier, and derive the marginalized loss of the autoencoder\nwith Laplace approximation. We show that our choice of loss function can be\nrationalized from the perspective of Bregman Divergence, which justifies the\nsoundness of our model. We evaluate the effectiveness of our model on six\nsentiment analysis datasets, and show that our model significantly outperforms\nall the competing methods with respect to classification accuracy. We also show\nthat our model is able to take advantage of unlabeled dataset and get improved\nperformance. We further show that our model successfully learns highly\ndiscriminative feature maps, which explains its superior performance.",

However, most existing schemes use the\nassumption that a buyer pays the same price per unit of energy to all suppliers\nat any particular time when energy is bought. By contrast, here a discriminate\npricing technique using game theory is studied. A cake cutting game is\ninvestigated, in which participating EUs in a smart community decide on the\nprice per unit of energy to charge a shared facility controller (SFC) in order\nto sell surplus energy. The focus is to study fairness criteria to maximize sum\nbenefits to EUs and ensure an envy-free energy trading market. A benefit\nfunction is designed that leverages generation of discriminate pricing by each\nEU, according to the amount of surplus energy that an EU trades with the SFC\nand the EU's sensitivity to price. It is shown that the game possesses a\nsocially optimal, and hence also Pareto optimal, solution. Further, an\nalgorithm that can be implemented by each EU in a distributed manner to reach\nthe optimal solution is proposed. Numerical case studies are given that\ndemonstrate beneficial properties of the scheme.",

This result was later extended to a class of\nincomplete-information two-player games by Harsanyi, who assumed that the\npayoff matrix is not known exactly but rather represents a random variable that\nis governed by a probability distribution known to both players.\n  In 2006, Bertsimas and Aghassi proposed a new class of distribution-free\ntwo-player games where the payoff matrix is only known to belong to a given\nuncertainty set. This model relaxes the distributional assumptions of\nHarsanyi's Bayesian games, and it gives rise to an alternative\ndistribution-free equilibrium concept.\n  In this thesis we present a new model of incomplete information games without\nprivate information in which the players use a distributionally robust\noptimization approach to cope with the payoff uncertainty. With some specific\nrestrictions, we show that our \"Distributionally Robust Game\" constitutes a\ntrue generalization of the three aforementioned finite games (Nash games,\nBayesian Games and Robust Games). Subsequently, we prove that the set of\nequilibria of an arbitrary distributionally robust game with specified\nambiguity set can be computed as the component-wise projection of the solution\nset of a multi-linear system of equations and inequalities.

    "abstract": "Current approaches for visual-inertial odometry (VIO) are able to attain\nhighly accurate state estimation via nonlinear optimization. However, real-time\noptimization quickly becomes infeasible as the trajectory grows over time, this\nproblem is further emphasized by the fact that inertial measurements come at\nhigh rate, hence leading to fast growth of the number of variables in the\noptimization. In this paper, we address this issue by preintegrating inertial\nmeasurements between selected keyframes into single relative motion\nconstraints. Our first contribution is a \\emph{preintegration theory} that\nproperly addresses the manifold structure of the rotation group. We formally\ndiscuss the generative measurement model as well as the nature of the rotation\nnoise and derive the expression for the \\emph{maximum a posteriori} state\nestimator. Our theoretical development enables the computation of all necessary\nJacobians for the optimization and a-posteriori bias correction in analytic\nform. The second contribution is to show that the preintegrated IMU model can\nbe seamlessly integrated into a visual-inertial pipeline under the unifying\nframework of factor graphs. This enables the application of\nincremental-smoothing algorithms and the use of a \\emph{structureless} model\nfor visual measurements, which avoids optimizing over the 3D points, further\naccelerating the computation. We perform an extensive evaluation of our\nmonocular \\VIO pipeline on real and simulated datasets. The results confirm\nthat our modelling effort leads to accurate state estimation in real-time,\noutperforming state-of-the-art approaches.",

Equal-image-size source partitioning divides\nthe source (combination of messages and codewords) into a sub-exponential\nnumber of subsets. Over each of these subsets, the exponential orders of the\nminimum image sizes of most messages are roughly equal to the same entropy\nterm. This property gives us the strength of minimum image sizes and the\nflexibility of entropy terms. Using the method of equal-image-size source\npartitioning, we prove separate necessary conditions for the existence of\naverage-error and maximum-error codes. These necessary conditions are much\nstronger than the standard Fano's inequality, and can be weakened to render\nversions of Fano's inequality that apply to codes with non-vanishing error\nprobabilities. To demonstrate the power of this new tool, we employ the\nstronger average-error version of Fano's inequality to prove the strong\nconverse for the discrete memoryless wiretap channel with decaying leakage,\nwhich heretofore has been an open problem.",

To solve the non-convex\noptimization problem, we propose a low-complexity scheme to approximate it.\nSimulation results demonstrate its effectiveness. We also investigate the\neffects of the circuit power consumption on system performances and observe\nthat with both the constant and the linearly rate-dependent circuit power\nconsumption, system EE grows with the increment of system average channel-to\nnoise ratio (CNR), but the growth rates show different behaviors. For the\nconstant circuit power consumption, system EE increasing rate is an increasing\nfunction of the system average CNR, while for the linearly rate-dependent one,\nsystem EE increasing rate is a decreasing function of the system average CNR.\nThis observation is very important which indicates that by deducing the circuit\ndynamic power consumption per unit data rate, system EE can be greatly\nenhanced.

To neutralize this bias, we\npropose a class of models with partial regularizers for recovering a sparse\nsolution of a linear system. We show that every local minimizer of these models\nis sufficiently sparse or the magnitude of all its nonzero entries is above a\nuniform constant depending only on the data of the linear system. Moreover, for\na class of partial regularizers, any global minimizer of these models is a\nsparsest solution to the linear system. We also establish some sufficient\nconditions for local or global recovery of the sparsest solution to the linear\nsystem, among which one of the conditions is weaker than the best known\nrestricted isometry property (RIP) condition for sparse recovery by $\\ell_1$.\nIn addition, a first-order feasible augmented Lagrangian (FAL) method is\nproposed for solving these models, in which each subproblem is solved by a\nnonmonotone proximal gradient (NPG) method. Despite the complication of the\npartial regularizers, we show that each proximal subproblem in NPG can be\nsolved as a certain number of one-dimensional optimization problems, which\nusually have a closed-form solution.

    "abstract": "Sharing economy is a distributed peer-to-peer economic paradigm, which gives\nrise to a variety of social interactions for economic purposes. One fundamental\ndistributed decision-making process is coalition formation for sharing certain\nreplaceable resources collaboratively, for example, sharing hotel rooms among\ntravelers, sharing taxi-rides among passengers, and sharing regular passes\namong users. Motivated by the applications of sharing economy, this paper\nstudies a coalition formation game subject to the capacity of $K$ participants\nper coalition. The participants in each coalition are supposed to split the\nassociated cost according to a given cost-sharing mechanism. A stable coalition\nstructure is established when no group of participants can opt out to form\nanother coalition that leads to lower individual payments. We quantify the\ninefficiency of distributed decision-making processes under a cost-sharing\nmechanism by the strong price of anarchy (SPoA), comparing a worst-case stable\ncoalition structure and a social optimum. In particular, we derive SPoA for\ncommon fair cost-sharing mechanisms (e.g., equal-split, proportional-split,\negalitarian and Nash bargaining solutions of bargaining games, and usage based\ncost-sharing). We show that the SPoA for equal-split, proportional-split, and\nusage based cost-sharing (under certain conditions) is $\\Theta(\\log K)$,\nwhereas the one for egalitarian and Nash bargaining solutions is $O(\\sqrt{K}\n\\log K)$. Therefore, distributed decision-making processes under common fair\ncost-sharing mechanisms induce only moderate inefficiency.",

    "abstract": "Modern data is messy and high-dimensional, and it is often not clear a priori\nwhat are the right questions to ask. Instead, the analyst typically needs to\nuse the data to search for interesting analyses to perform and hypotheses to\ntest. This is an adaptive process, where the choice of analysis to be performed\nnext depends on the results of the previous analyses on the same data.\nUltimately, which results are reported can be heavily influenced by the data.\nIt is widely recognized that this process, even if well-intentioned, can lead\nto biases and false discoveries, contributing to the crisis of reproducibility\nin science. But while %the adaptive nature of exploration any data-exploration\nrenders standard statistical theory invalid, experience suggests that different\ntypes of exploratory analysis can lead to disparate levels of bias, and the\ndegree of bias also depends on the particulars of the data set. In this paper,\nwe propose a general information usage framework to quantify and provably bound\nthe bias and other error metrics of an arbitrary exploratory analysis. We prove\nthat our mutual information based bound is tight in natural settings, and then\nuse it to give rigorous insights into when commonly used procedures do or do\nnot lead to substantially biased estimation. Through the lens of information\nusage, we analyze the bias of specific exploration procedures such as\nfiltering, rank selection and clustering. Our general framework also naturally\nmotivates randomization techniques that provably reduces exploration bias while\npreserving the utility of the data analysis. We discuss the connections between\nour approach and related ideas from differential privacy and blinded data\nanalysis, and supplement our results with illustrative simulations.",

EEG data are generally only available in small quantities, they are\nhigh-dimensional with a poor signal-to-noise ratio, and there is considerable\nvariability between individual subjects and recording sessions. Our proposed\ntechniques specifically address these challenges for feature learning.\nCross-trial encoding forces auto-encoders to focus on features that are stable\nacross trials. Similarity-constraint encoders learn features that allow to\ndistinguish between classes by demanding that two trials from the same class\nare more similar to each other than to trials from other classes. This\ntuple-based training approach is especially suitable for small datasets.\nHydra-nets allow for separate processing pathways adapting to subsets of a\ndataset and thus combine the advantages of individual feature learning (better\nadaptation of early, low-level processing) with group model training (better\ngeneralization of higher-level processing in deeper layers). This way, models\ncan, for instance, adapt to each subject individually to compensate for\ndifferences in spatial patterns due to anatomical differences or variance in\nelectrode positions. The different techniques are evaluated using the publicly\navailable OpenMIIR dataset of EEG recordings taken while participants listened\nto and imagined music.",

The main component of\nour analysis is a simple (given the necessary known tools) lower bound on\ncentral notion of capacity of operators (introduced by Gurvits). We extend the\nalgorithm to actually approximate capacity to any accuracy in polynomial time,\nand use this analysis to give quantitative bounds on the continuity of capacity\n(the latter is used in a subsequent paper on Brascamp-Lieb inequalities).\n  Symbolic matrices in non-commuting variables, and the related structural and\nalgorithmic questions, have a remarkable number of diverse origins and\nmotivations.

To better utilize the limited BSs'\nresources under unreliable wireless networks, we propose local common-interests\nsharing (enabled by D2D communications) by motivating the physically\nneighboring users to form a social group. As users are selfish in practice, an\nincentive mechanism is needed to motivate social grouping.

While the robust versions have been\nstudied in the theory community, existing work has focused on tight\napproximation guarantees, and the resultant algorithms are not, in general,\nscalable to very large real-world applications. This is in contrast to the\naverage case, where most of the algorithms are scalable. In the present paper,\nwe bridge this gap, by proposing several new algorithms (including those based\non greedy, majorization-minimization, minorization-maximization, and relaxation\nalgorithms) that not only scale to large sizes but that also achieve\ntheoretical approximation guarantees close to the state-of-the-art, and in some\ncases achieve new tight bounds.

We show that these problems have many applications in machine\nlearning (ML).

This\nopen-editing nature may give us prejudice that Wikipedia is an unstable and\nunreliable source; yet many studies suggest that Wikipedia is even more\naccurate and self-consistent than traditional encyclopedias. Scholars have\nattempted to understand such extraordinary credibility, but usually used the\nnumber of edits as the unit of time, without consideration of real time. In\nthis work, we probe the formation of such collective intelligence through a\nsystematic analysis using the entire history of 34,534,110 English Wikipedia\narticles, between 2001 and 2014. From this massive data set, we observe the\nuniversality of both timewise and lengthwise editing scales, which suggests\nthat it is essential to consider the real-time dynamics. By considering real\ntime, we find the existence of distinct growth patterns that are unobserved by\nutilizing the number of edits as the unit of time. To account for these\nresults, we present a mechanistic model that adopts the article editing\ndynamics based on both editor-editor and editor-article interactions. The model\nsuccessfully generates the key properties of real Wikipedia articles such as\ndistinct types of articles for the editing patterns characterized by the\ninterrelationship between the numbers of edits and editors, and the article\nsize.

Resource- and population-monotonicity relate to\nscenarios where the cake, or the number of participants who divide the cake,\nchanges. It is required that the utility of all participants change in the same\ndirection: either all of them are better-off (if there is more to share or\nfewer to share among) or all are worse-off (if there is less to share or more\nto share among).\n  We formally introduce these concepts to the cake-cutting problem and examine\nwhether they are satisfied by various common division rules. We prove that the\nNash-optimal rule, which maximizes the product of utilities, is\nresource-monotonic and population-monotonic, in addition to being\nPareto-optimal, envy-free and satisfying a strong competitive-equilibrium\ncondition.

One common theme which emerges in these fields is\nprobabilistic stability: complicated, nonlinear functions of a large number of\nindependent or weakly dependent random variables often tend to concentrate\nsharply around their expected values. Information theory plays a key role in\nthe derivation of concentration inequalities. Indeed, both the entropy method\nand the approach based on transportation-cost inequalities are two major\ninformation-theoretic paths toward proving concentration.\n  This brief survey is based on a recent monograph of the authors in the\nFoundations and Trends in Communications and Information Theory (online\navailable at http://arxiv.org/pdf/1212.4663v8.pdf), and a tutorial given by the\nauthors at ISIT 2015.

    "abstract": "In a world where traditional notions of privacy are increasingly challenged\nby the myriad companies that collect and analyze our data, it is important that\ndecision-making entities are held accountable for unfair treatments arising\nfrom irresponsible data usage. Unfortunately, a lack of appropriate\nmethodologies and tools means that even identifying unfair or discriminatory\neffects can be a challenge in practice. We introduce the unwarranted\nassociations (UA) framework, a principled methodology for the discovery of\nunfair, discriminatory, or offensive user treatment in data-driven\napplications. The UA framework unifies and rationalizes a number of prior\nattempts at formalizing algorithmic fairness. It uniquely combines multiple\ninvestigative primitives and fairness metrics with broad applicability,\ngranular exploration of unfair treatment in user subgroups, and incorporation\nof natural notions of utility that may account for observed disparities. We\ninstantiate the UA framework in FairTest, the first comprehensive tool that\nhelps developers check data-driven applications for unfair user treatment. It\nenables scalable and statistically rigorous investigation of associations\nbetween application outcomes (such as prices or premiums) and sensitive user\nattributes (such as race or gender). Furthermore, FairTest provides debugging\ncapabilities that let programmers rule out potential confounders for observed\nunfair effects. We report on use of FairTest to investigate and in some cases\naddress disparate impact, offensive labeling, and uneven rates of algorithmic\nerror in four data-driven applications. As examples, our results reveal subtle\nbiases against older populations in the distribution of error in a predictive\nhealth application and offensive racial labeling in an image tagger.",

To save computation time, the Markov\nchains are only run for a small number of steps, which leads to a biased\nestimate. This bias can cause RBM training algorithms such as Contrastive\nDivergence (CD) learning to deteriorate. We adopt the idea behind Population\nMonte Carlo (PMC) methods to devise a new RBM training algorithm termed\nPopulation-Contrastive-Divergence (pop-CD). Compared to CD, it leads to a\nconsistent estimate and may have a significantly lower bias. Its computational\noverhead is negligible compared to CD. However, the variance of the gradient\nestimate increases. We experimentally show that pop-CD can significantly\noutperform CD. In many cases, we observed a smaller bias and achieved higher\nlog-likelihood values. However, when the RBM distribution has many hidden\nneurons, the consistent estimate of pop-CD may still have a considerable bias\nand the variance of the gradient estimate requires a smaller learning rate.\nThus, despite its superior theoretical properties, it is not advisable to use\npop-CD in its current form on large problems.",

On the other side of the spectrum, neuromorphic\nsystems have shown great promise for low-power and parallelized cognitive\ncomputing, but lack well-suited applications and automation procedures. In this\nwork, we propose a systematic method for bridging the RBM algorithm and digital\nneuromorphic systems, with a generative pattern completion task as proof of\nconcept. For this, we first propose a method of producing the Gibbs sampler\nusing bio-inspired digital noisy integrate-and-fire neurons. Next, we describe\nthe process of mapping generative RBMs trained offline onto the IBM TrueNorth\nneurosynaptic processor -- a low-power digital neuromorphic VLSI substrate.\nMapping these algorithms onto neuromorphic hardware presents unique challenges\nin network connectivity and weight and bias quantization, which, in turn,\nrequire architectural and design strategies for the physical realization.\nGenerative performance metrics are analyzed to validate the neuromorphic\nrequirements and to best select the neuron parameters for the model. Lastly, we\ndescribe a design automation procedure which achieves optimal resource usage,\naccounting for the novel hardware adaptations.

We show that most features deemed\nefficient to predict online influence, such as the numbers of retweets and\nfollowers, are not relevant to this problem.

Fruit flies exposed to a\nfeatureless environment deviated the most from Levy flight, suggesting an\nalgorithmic bias in their attempt to devise a useful (navigation) strategy.\nSimilarly, a logical depth analysis of rats revealed that the structural\ncomplexity of the rat always ends up matching the structural complexity of the\ncompetitor, with the rats' behaviour simulating algorithmic randomness.\nFinally, we discuss how experiments on how humans perceive randomness suggest\nthe existence of an algorithmic bias in our reasoning and decision processes,\nin line with our analysis of the animal experiments.",

However, there is still an unaddressed challenge:\nthe application-specific dependability in terms of sensor fault detection and\ntolerance. The dependability is also affected by a reduction on the quality of\nmonitoring when mitigating WSN constrains (e.g., limited energy, narrow\nbandwidth). We address these by designing a dependable distributed WSN\nframework for SHM (called DependSHM) and then examining its ability to cope\nwith sensor faults and constraints. We find evidence that faulty sensors can\ncorrupt results of a health event (e.g., damage) in a structural system without\nbeing detected. More specifically, we bring attention to an undiscovered yet\ninteresting fact, i.e., the real measured signals introduced by one or more\nfaulty sensors may cause an undamaged location to be identified as damaged\n(false positive) or a damaged location as undamaged (false negative) diagnosis.\nThis can be caused by faults in sensor bonding, precision degradation,\namplification gain, bias, drift, noise, and so forth. In DependSHM, we present\na distributed automated algorithm to detect such types of faults, and we offer\nan online signal reconstruction algorithm to recover from the wrong diagnosis.\nThrough comprehensive simulations and a WSN prototype system implementation, we\nevaluate the effectiveness of DependSHM.",

I demonstrate one such application-analyzing\nthe impact of physical barriers on residential segregation-with a stylized\nexample and an empirical analysis of racial segregation in Pittsburgh, PA. The\nSPC method contributes to scholarship on residential segregation by capturing\nthe effect of an important yet understudied mechanism of segregation-the\nconnectivity, or physical barriers, between locations-on the level and spatial\npattern of segregation, and enables further consideration of the role of the\nbuilt environment in segregation processes.",

However,\naccurate automated segmentation remains challenging due to the presence of\nnoise, inhomogeneity and the high appearance variability of malignant tissue.\nIn this paper, we propose an unsupervised metastatic liver tumour segmentation\nframework using a machine learning approach based on discriminant Grassmannian\nmanifolds which learns the appearance of tumours with respect to normal tissue.\nFirst, the framework learns within-class and between-class similarity\ndistributions from a training set of images to discover the optimal manifold\ndiscrimination between normal and pathological tissue in the liver. Second, a\nconditional optimisation scheme computes nonlocal pairwise as well as\npattern-based clique potentials from the manifold subspace to recognise regions\nwith similar labelings and to incorporate global consistency in the\nsegmentation process. The proposed framework was validated on a clinical\ndatabase of 43 CT images from patients with metastatic liver cancer. Compared\nto state-of-the-art methods, our method achieves a better performance on two\nseparate datasets of metastatic liver tumours from different clinical sites,\nyielding an overall mean Dice similarity coefficient of 90.7 +/- 2.4 in over 50\ntumours with an average volume of 27.3 mm3.",

    "abstract": "In the emerging hybrid electricity market, mobile network operators (MNOs) of\ncellular networks can make day-ahead energy purchase commitments at low prices\nand real-time flexible energy purchase at high prices. To minimize electricity\nbills, it is essential for MNOs to jointly optimize the day-ahead and real-time\nenergy purchase based on their time-varying wireless traffic load. In this\npaper, we consider two different MNOs coexisting in the same area, and exploit\ntheir collaboration in both energy purchase and wireless load sharing for\nenergy cost saving. Specifically, we propose a new approach named energy group\nbuying with load sharing, in which the two MNOs are aggregated as a single\ngroup to make the day-ahead and real-time energy purchase, and their base\nstations (BSs) share the wireless traffic to maximally turn lightly-loaded BSs\ninto sleep mode. When the two MNOs belong to the same entity and aim to\nminimize their total energy cost, we use the two-stage stochastic programming\nto obtain the optimal day-ahead and real-time energy group buying jointly with\nwireless load sharing. When the two MNOs belong to different entities and are\nself-interested in minimizing their individual energy costs, we propose a novel\nrepeated Nash bargaining scheme for them to negotiate and share their energy\ncosts under energy group buying and load sharing. Our proposed repeated Nash\nbargaining scheme is shown to achieve Pareto-optimal and fair energy cost\nreductions for both MNOs.",

Various\nchannel-dependent improvements (called strong data-processing inequalities, or\nSDPIs) of this inequality have been proposed both classically and more\nrecently. In this note we first survey known results relating various notions\nof contraction for a single channel. Then we consider the basic extension:\ngiven SDPI for each constituent channel in a Bayesian network, how to produce\nan end-to-end SDPI?\n  Our approach is based on the (extract of the) Evans-Schulman method, which is\ndemonstrated for three different kinds of SDPIs, namely, the usual\nAhslwede-G\\'acs type contraction coefficients (mutual information), Dobrushin's\ncontraction coefficients (total variation), and finally the $F_I$-curve (the\nbest possible non-linear SDPI for a given channel). Resulting bounds on the\ncontraction coefficients are interpreted as probability of site percolation. As\nan example, we demonstrate how to obtain SDPI for an $n$-letter memoryless\nchannel with feedback given an SDPI for $n=1$.\n  Finally, we discuss a simple observation on the equivalence of a linear SDPI\nand comparison to an erasure channel (in the sense of \"less noisy\" order). This\nleads to a simple proof of a curious inequality of Samorodnitsky (2015), and\nsheds light on how information spreads in the subsets of inputs of a memoryless\nchannel.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, a class of broadcast interference channels (BIC) is\ninvestigated, where one of the two broadcast receivers is subject to\ninterference coming from a point-to-point transmission. For a general discrete\nmemoryless broadcast interference channel (DM-BIC), an achievable scheme based\non message splitting, superposition and binning is proposed and a concise\nrepresentation of the corresponding achievable rate region R is obtained. Two\npartial-order broadcast conditions interference-oblivious less noisy and\ninterference-cognizant less noisy are defined, thereby extending the usual less\nnoisy condition for a regular broadcast channel by taking interference into\naccount. Under these conditions, a reduced form of R is shown to be equivalent\nto a rate region based on a simpler scheme, where the broadcast transmitter\nuses only superposition. Furthermore, if interference is strong for the\ninterference-oblivious less noisy DM-BIC, the capacity region is given by the\naforementioned two equivalent rate regions. For a Gaussian broadcast\ninterference channel (GBIC), channel parameters are categorized into three\nregimes. For the first two regimes, which are closely related to the two\npartial-order broadcast conditions, achievable rate regions are derived by\nspecializing the corresponding achievable schemes of DM-BICs with Gaussian\ninput distributions. The entropy power inequality (EPI) based outer bounds are\nobtained by combining bounding techniques for a Gaussian broadcast channel\n(GBC) and a Gaussian interference channel (GIC). These inner and outer bounds\nlead to either exact or approximate characterizations of capacity regions and\nsum capacity under various conditions. For the remaining complementing regime,\ninner and outer bounds are also provided.",

The independent randomized rounding method of Raghavan-Thompson\nrounds each variable $x_i$ to 1 with probability $\\overset{\\sim}{x_i}$ and 0\notherwise. The expected value of the rounded objective function matches the\nfractional optimum and no constraint is violated by more than $O(\\frac{\\log m}\n{\\log\\log m})$.In contrast, our algorithm iteratively transforms\n$\\overset{\\sim}{x}$ to $\\hat{x} \\in {\\{ 0,1\\}}^{n}$ using a random walk, such\nthat the expected values of $\\hat{x}_i$'s are consistent with the\nRaghavan-Thompson rounding. In addition, it gives us intermediate values $x'$\nwhich can then be used to bias the rounding towards a superior solution.The\nreduced dependencies between the constraints of the sparser system can be\nexploited using {\\it Lovasz Local Lemma}.

Further, we\nexplore trade-offs between approximation factors and error, and present\napplications to well-known problems like circuit-switching, maximum independent\nset of rectangles and hypergraph $b$-matching.

    "abstract": "We present a bouquet of continuity bounds for quantum entropies, falling\nbroadly into two classes: First, a tight analysis of the Alicki-Fannes\ncontinuity bounds for the conditional von Neumann entropy, reaching almost the\nbest possible form that depends only on the system dimension and the trace\ndistance of the states. Almost the same proof can be used to derive similar\ncontinuity bounds for the relative entropy distance from a convex set of states\nor positive operators. As applications we give new proofs, with tighter bounds,\nof the asymptotic continuity of the relative entropy of entanglement, $E_R$,\nand its regularization $E_R^\\infty$, as well as of the entanglement of\nformation, $E_F$. Using a novel \"quantum coupling\" of density operators, which\nmay be of independent interest, we extend the latter to an asymptotic\ncontinuity bound for the regularized entanglement of formation, aka\nentanglement cost, $E_C=E_F^\\infty$.\n  Second, analogous continuity bounds for the von Neumann entropy and\nconditional entropy in infinite dimensional systems under an energy constraint,\nmost importantly systems of multiple quantum harmonic oscillators. While\nwithout an energy bound the entropy is discontinuous, it is well-known to be\ncontinuous on states of bounded energy. However, a quantitative statement to\nthat effect seems not to have been known. Here, under some regularity\nassumptions on the Hamiltonian, we find that, quite intuitively, the Gibbs\nentropy at the given energy roughly takes the role of the Hilbert space\ndimension in the finite-dimensional Fannes inequality.",

A design criterion based on the normalized minimum determinant is\nproposed for division algebra multiblock space-time codes over fading channels;\nthis plays a similar role to the Hermite invariant for Gaussian channels. It is\nshown that this criterion is sufficient to guarantee transmission rates within\na constant gap from capacity both for slow fading channels and ergodic fading\nchannels. This performance is achieved both under maximum likelihood decoding\nand naive lattice decoding. In the case of independent identically distributed\nRayleigh fading, it is also shown that the error probability vanishes\nexponentially fast. In contrast to the standard approach in the literature\nwhich employs random lattice ensembles, the existence results in this paper are\nderived from number theory. First the gap to capacity is shown to depend on the\ndiscriminant of the chosen division algebra; then class field theory is applied\nto build families of algebras with small discriminants. The key element in the\nconstruction is the choice of a sequence of division algebras whose centers are\nnumber fields with small root discriminants.",

    "abstract": "A large and diverse set of measurements are regularly collected during a\npatient's hospital stay to monitor their health status. Tools for integrating\nthese measurements into severity scores, that accurately track changes in\nillness severity, can improve clinicians ability to provide timely\ninterventions. Existing approaches for creating such scores either 1) rely on\nexperts to fully specify the severity score, or 2) train a predictive score,\nusing supervised learning, by regressing against a surrogate marker of severity\nsuch as the presence of downstream adverse events. The first approach does not\nextend to diseases where an accurate score cannot be elicited from experts. The\nsecond approach often produces scores that suffer from bias due to\ntreatment-related censoring (Paxton, 2013). We propose a novel ranking based\nframework for disease severity score learning (DSSL). DSSL exploits the\nfollowing key observation: while it is challenging for experts to quantify the\ndisease severity at any given time, it is often easy to compare the disease\nseverity at two different times. Extending existing ranking algorithms, DSSL\nlearns a function that maps a vector of patient's measurements to a scalar\nseverity score such that the resulting score is temporally smooth and\nconsistent with the expert's ranking of pairs of disease states. We apply DSSL\nto the problem of learning a sepsis severity score using a large, real-world\ndataset. The learned scores significantly outperform state-of-the-art clinical\nscores in ranking patient states by severity and in early detection of future\nadverse events. We also show that the learned disease severity trajectories are\nconsistent with clinical expectations of disease evolution. Further, using\nsimulated datasets, we show that DSSL exhibits better generalization\nperformance to changes in treatment patterns compared to the above approaches.",

The problem of outage balancing among the users is studied with\nthe issues of power allocation, decoding order selection, and user grouping\nbeing taken into account. Specifically, with regard to the max-min fairness\ncriterion, we derive the optimal power allocation in closed-form and prove the\ncorresponding optimal decoding order for the elementary downlink NOMA system.\nBy assigning a weighting factor for each user, the analytical results can be\nused to evaluate the outage performance of the downlink NOMA system under\nvarious fairness constraints. Further, we investigate the case with user\ngrouping, in which each user group can be treated as an elementary downlink\nNOMA system. The associated problems of power and resource allocation among\ndifferent user groups are solved. The implementation complexity issue of NOMA\nis also considered with focus on that caused by successive interference\ncancellation and user grouping. The complexity and performance tradeoff is\nanalyzed by simulations, which provides fruitful insights for the practical\napplication of NOMA. The simulation results substantiate our analysis and show\nconsiderable performance gain of NOMA when compared with orthogonal multiple\naccess.",

    "abstract": "Why do human languages change at some times, and not others? We address this\nlongstanding question from a computational perspective, focusing on the case of\nsound change. Sound change arises from the pronunciation variability ubiquitous\nin every speech community, but most such variability does not lead to change.\nHence, an adequate model must allow for stability as well as change. Existing\ntheories of sound change tend to emphasize factors at the level of individual\nlearners promoting one outcome or the other, such as channel bias (which favors\nchange) or inductive bias (which favors stability). Here, we consider how the\ninteraction of these biases can lead to both stability and change in a\npopulation setting. We find that population structure itself can act as a\nsource of stability, but that both stability and change are possible only when\nboth types of bias are active, suggesting that it is possible to understand why\nsound change occurs at some times and not others as the population-level result\nof the interplay between forces promoting each outcome in individual speakers.\nIn addition, if it is assumed that learners learn from two or more teachers,\nthe transition from stability to change is marked by a phase transition,\nconsistent with the abrupt transitions seen in many empirical cases of sound\nchange. The predictions of multiple-teacher models thus match empirical cases\nof sound change better than the predictions of single-teacher models,\nunderscoring the importance of modeling language change in a population\nsetting.",

The classical prophet inequality states that\nby choosing the same threshold OPT/2 for every step, one can achieve the tight\ncompetitive ratio of 0.5. On the other hand, for the basic secretary problem,\nthe optimal strategy achieves the tight competitive ratio of 1/e.\n  In this paper, we introduce Prophet Secretary, a natural combination of the\nprophet inequality and the secretary problems. An example motivation for our\nproblem is as follows. Consider a seller that has an item to sell on the market\nto a set of arriving customers. The seller knows the types of customers that\nmay be interested in the item and he has a price distribution for each type:\nthe price offered by a customer of a type is anticipated to be drawn from the\ncorresponding distribution. However, the customers arrive in a random order.\nUpon the arrival of a customer, the seller makes an irrevocable decision\nwhether to sell the item at the offered price. We address the question of\nfinding a strategy for selling the item at a high price.\n  We show that by using a uniform threshold one cannot break the 0.5 barrier.\nHowever, we show that i) using n distinct non-adaptive thresholds one can\nobtain a competitive ratio that goes to (1-1/e) as n grows; and ii) no online\nalgorithm can achieve a competitive ratio better than 0.75.

The content individuals produce in daily social-media-based\nmicro-communications, and the emotions therein expressed, may impact the\nemotional states of others. A recent experiment performed on Facebook\nhypothesized that emotions spread online, even in absence of non-verbal cues\ntypical of in-person interactions, and that individuals are more likely to\nadopt positive or negative emotions if these are over-expressed in their social\nnetwork. Experiments of this type, however, raise ethical concerns, as they\nrequire massive-scale content manipulation with unknown consequences for the\nindividuals therein involved. Here, we study the dynamics of emotional\ncontagion using Twitter. Rather than manipulating content, we devise a null\nmodel that discounts some confounding factors (including the effect of\nemotional contagion). We measure the emotional valence of content the users are\nexposed to before posting their own tweets. We determine that on average a\nnegative post follows an over-exposure to 4.34% more negative content than\nbaseline, while positive posts occur after an average over-exposure to 4.50%\nmore positive contents. We highlight the presence of a linear relationship\nbetween the average emotional valence of the stimuli users are exposed to, and\nthat of the responses they produce. We also identify two different classes of\nindividuals: highly and scarcely susceptible to emotional contagion. Highly\nsusceptible users are significantly less inclined to adopt negative emotions\nthan the scarcely susceptible ones, but equally likely to adopt positive\nemotions. In general, the likelihood of adopting positive emotions is much\ngreater than that of negative emotions.",

In practice, CFRSs are also\nparticularly vulnerable to \"shilling\" attacks or \"profile injection\" attacks\ndue to their openness. The attackers can carefully inject chosen attack\nprofiles into CFRSs in order to bias the recommendation results to their\nbenefits. To reduce this risk, various detection techniques have been proposed\nto detect such attacks, which use diverse features extracted from user\nprofiles. However, relying on limited features to improve the detection\nperformance is difficult seemingly, since the existing features can not fully\ncharacterize the attack profiles and genuine profiles. In this paper, we\npropose a novel detection method to make recommender systems resistant to the\n\"shilling\" attacks or \"profile injection\" attacks. The existing features can be\nbriefly summarized as two aspects including rating behavior based and item\ndistribution based. We firstly formulate the problem as finding a mapping model\nbetween rating behavior and item distribution by exploiting the least-squares\napproximate solution. Based on the trained model, we design a detector by\nemploying a regressor to detect such attacks. Extensive experiments on both the\nMovieLens-100K and MovieLens-ml-latest-small datasets examine the effectiveness\nof our proposed detection method.

The constraint satisfaction problem for max-closed\nsemilinear constraints is at least as hard as determining the winner in Mean\nPayoff Games, a notorious problem of open computational complexity. Mean Payoff\nGames are known to be in the intersection of NP and co-NP, which is not known\nfor max-closed semilinear constraints. Semilinear relations that are max-closed\nand additionally closed under translations have been called tropically convex\nin the literature. One of our main results is a new duality for open tropically\nconvex relations, which puts the CSP for tropically convex semilinaer\nconstraints in general into NP intersected co-NP. This extends the\ncorresponding complexity result for scheduling under and-or precedence\nconstraints, or equivalently the max-atoms problem. To this end, we present a\ncharacterization of max-closed semilinear relations in terms of syntactically\nrestricted first-order logic, and another characterization in terms of a finite\nset of relations L that allow primitive positive definitions of all other\nrelations in the class. We also present a subclass of max-closed constraints\nwhere the CSP is in P; this class generalizes the class of max-closed\nconstraints over finite domains, and the feasibility problem for max-closed\nlinear inequalities. Finally, we show that the class of max-closed semilinear\nconstraints is maximal in the sense that as soon as a single relation that is\nnot max-closed is added to L, the CSP becomes NP-hard.",

In\nthe case of delay sensitive applications, a large delay might not be acceptable\nand a solution to properly manage congestion events while maintaining a low\nend-to-end delay is required. Delay-based congestion algorithms are a viable\nsolution as they target to limit the experienced end-to-end delay.\nUnfortunately, they do not perform well when sharing the bandwidth with\ncongestion control algorithms not regulated by delay constraints (e.g.,\nloss-based algorithms). Our target is to fill this gap, proposing a novel\ncongestion control algorithm for delay-constrained communication over best\neffort packet switched networks. The proposed algorithm is able to maintain a\nbounded queueing delay when competing with other delay-based flows, and avoid\nstarvation when competing with loss-based flows. We adopt the well-known\nprice-based distributed mechanism as congestion control, but: 1) we introduce a\nnovel non-linear mapping between the experienced delay and the price function\nand 2) we combine both delay and loss information into a single price term\nbased on packet interarrival measurements. We then provide a stability analysis\nfor our novel algorithm and we show its performance in the simulation results\ncarried out in the NS3 framework. Simulation results demonstrate that the\nproposed algorithm is able to: achieve good intra-protocol fairness properties,\ncontrol efficiently the end-to-end delay, and finally, protect the flow from\nstarvation when other flows cause the queuing delay to grow excessively.",

    "abstract": "Matching the profiles of a user across multiple online social networks brings\nopportunities for new services and applications as well as new insights on user\nonline behavior, yet it raises serious privacy concerns. Prior literature has\nproposed methods to match profiles and showed that it is possible to do it\naccurately, but using evaluations that focused on sampled datasets only. In\nthis paper, we study the extent to which we can reliably match profiles in\npractice, across real-world social networks, by exploiting public attributes,\ni.e., information users publicly provide about themselves. Today's social\nnetworks have hundreds of millions of users, which brings completely new\nchallenges as a reliable matching scheme must identify the correct matching\nprofile out of the millions of possible profiles. We first define a set of\nproperties for profile attributes--Availability, Consistency,\nnon-Impersonability, and Discriminability (ACID)--that are both necessary and\nsufficient to determine the reliability of a matching scheme. Using these\nproperties, we propose a method to evaluate the accuracy of matching schemes in\nreal practical cases. Our results show that the accuracy in practice is\nsignificantly lower than the one reported in prior literature. When considering\nentire social networks, there is a non-negligible number of profiles that\nbelong to different users but have similar attributes, which leads to many\nfalse matches. Our paper sheds light on the limits of matching profiles in the\nreal world and illustrates the correct methodology to evaluate matching schemes\nin realistic scenarios.",

The polynomial\nis said to have low rank if it can be expressed as a composition of a few lower\ndegree polynomials. Green and Tao [Contrib. Discrete Math 2009] and Kaufman and\nLovett [FOCS 2008] showed that bias implies low rank for fixed degree\npolynomials over fixed prime fields. This lies at the heart of many tools in\nhigher order Fourier analysis. In this work, we extend this result to all prime\nfields (of size possibly growing with $n$). We also provide a generalization to\nnonprime fields in the large characteristic case. However, we state all our\napplications in the prime field setting for the sake of simplicity of\npresentation.\n  Using the above generalization to large fields as a starting point, we are\nalso able to settle the list decoding radius of fixed degree Reed-Muller codes\nover growing fields. The case of fixed size fields was solved by Bhowmick and\nLovett [STOC 2015], which resolved a conjecture of Gopalan-Klivans-Zuckerman\n[STOC 2008]. Here, we show that the list decoding radius is equal the minimum\ndistance of the code for all fixed degrees, even when the field size is\npossibly growing with $n$.\n  Additionally, we effectively resolve the weight distribution problem for\nReed-Muller codes of fixed degree over all fields, first raised in 1977 in the\nclassic textbook by MacWilliams and Sloane [Research Problem 15.1 in Theory of\nError Correcting Codes].",

    "abstract": "We model a market in which nonstrategic vendors sell items of different types\nand offer bundles at discounted prices triggered by demand volumes. Each buyer\nacts strategically in order to maximize her utility, given by the difference\nbetween product valuation and price paid. Buyers report their valuations in\nterms of reserve prices on sets of items, and might be willing to pay prices\ndifferent than the market price in order to subsidize other buyers and to\ntrigger discounts. The resulting price discrimination can be interpreted as a\nredistribution of the total discount. We consider a notion of stability that\nlooks at unilateral deviations, and show that efficient allocations - the ones\nmaximizing the social welfare - can be stabilized by prices that enjoy\ndesirable properties of rationality and fairness. These dictate that buyers pay\nhigher prices only to subsidize others who contribute to the activation of the\ndesired discounts, and that they pay premiums over the discounted price\nproportionally to their surplus - the difference between their current utility\nand the utility of their best alternative. Therefore, the resulting price\ndiscrimination appears to be desirable to buyers. Building on this existence\nresult, and letting N, M and c be the numbers of buyers, vendors and product\ntypes, we propose a O(N^2+NM^c) algorithm that, given an efficient allocation,\ncomputes prices that are rational and fair and that stabilize the market. The\nalgorithm first determines the redistribution of the discount between groups of\nbuyers with an equal product choice, and then computes single buyers' prices.\nOur results show that if a desirable form of price discrimination is\nimplemented then social efficiency and stability can coexists in a market\npresenting subtle externalities, and computing individual prices from market\nprices is tractable.",

To discover underlying local\nstructures in the gradient domain, we compute image gradients from multiple\ndirections and simplify them into a set of binary strings. The SBGP is derived\nfrom certain types of these binary strings that have meaningful local\nstructures and are capable of resembling fundamental textural information. They\ndetect micro orientational edges and possess strong orientation and locality\ncapabilities, thus enabling great discrimination. The SBGP also benefits from\nthe advantages of the gradient domain and exhibits profound robustness against\nillumination variations. The binary strategy realized by pixel correlations in\na small neighborhood substantially simplifies the computational complexity and\nachieves extremely efficient processing with only 0.0032s in Matlab for a\ntypical face image. Furthermore, the discrimination power of the SBGP can be\nenhanced on a set of defined orientational image gradient magnitudes, further\nenforcing locality and orientation. Results of extensive experiments on various\nbenchmark databases illustrate significant improvements of the SBGP based\nrepresentations over the existing state-of-the-art local descriptors in the\nterms of discrimination, robustness and complexity.

The protocol completion problem then is to find\ninterpretations for these unknown functions while guaranteeing correctness. In\nmany distributed protocols, process behaviors are naturally symmetric, and\nthus, synthesized expressions are further required to obey symmetry\nconstraints.

Given an\nattribute name, we use crowdsourced image labels to discover the latent factors\nunderlying how different annotators perceive the named concept. We show that\nstructure in those latent factors helps reveal shades, that is, interpretations\nfor the attribute shared by some group of annotators. Using these shades, we\ntrain classifiers to capture the primary (often subtle) variants of the\nattribute. The resulting models are both semantic and visually precise. By\ncatering to users' interpretations, they improve attribute prediction accuracy\non novel images. Shades also enable more successful attribute-based image\nsearch, by providing robust personalized models for retrieving multi-attribute\nquery results. They are widely applicable to tasks that involve describing\nvisual content, such as zero-shot category learning and organization of photo\ncollections.",

    "abstract": "Given a high-dimensional data set we often wish to find the strongest\nrelationships within it. A common strategy is to evaluate a measure of\ndependence on every variable pair and retain the highest-scoring pairs for\nfollow-up. This strategy works well if the statistic used is equitable [Reshef\net al. 2015a], i.e., if, for some measure of noise, it assigns similar scores\nto equally noisy relationships regardless of relationship type (e.g., linear,\nexponential, periodic).\n  In this paper, we introduce and characterize a population measure of\ndependence called MIC*. We show three ways that MIC* can be viewed: as the\npopulation value of MIC, a highly equitable statistic from [Reshef et al.\n2011], as a canonical \"smoothing\" of mutual information, and as the supremum of\nan infinite sequence defined in terms of optimal one-dimensional partitions of\nthe marginals of the joint distribution. Based on this theory, we introduce an\nefficient approach for computing MIC* from the density of a pair of random\nvariables, and we define a new consistent estimator MICe for MIC* that is\nefficiently computable. In contrast, there is no known polynomial-time\nalgorithm for computing the original equitable statistic MIC. We show through\nsimulations that MICe has better bias-variance properties than MIC. We then\nintroduce and prove the consistency of a second statistic, TICe, that is a\ntrivial side-product of the computation of MICe and whose goal is powerful\nindependence testing rather than equitability.\n  We show in simulations that MICe and TICe have good equitability and power\nagainst independence respectively. The analyses here complement a more in-depth\nempirical evaluation of several leading measures of dependence [Reshef et al.\n2015b] that shows state-of-the-art performance for MICe and TICe.",

Second, we exploit the generative capability of\nDCRBMs to activate the trained model so as to generate the lower-level data\ncorresponding to the specific ESIP that closely matches the actual training\ndata (with mean square error 0.01-0.1 for generating 100 frames).

To date, most of the previous research only consider a partial\naspect of the cost optimization problem. As a result, they fail to analyze\nscenarios when the interconnected components along with their properties have\nto be considered simultaneously. The proposed model combines these partial\nmodels into a single unified cost optimization model. Therefore, it is able to\nanalyze scenarios which are closer to practical implementation. Furthermore, it\nis useful to analyze the behavior of a population (e.g., smart buildings, smart\ncities, etc.) and properties of the components for specific scenarios (e.g.,\nthe impact of aggregate storage capacity, etc.). It allows energy trading in\nmicrogrid which introduces a cost fairness problem. It ensures Pareto\noptimality among the households which guarantees that no household will be\nworse off to improve the cost of others. Results show that it can maintain the\nuser preferences and can react to a demand response program by rescheduling the\nhousehold loads and sources. Finally, the paper addresses the challenge of the\ncomputational complexity of the proposed model, showing that solution time\nincreases exponentially with the problem size and proposes possible approaches\nto solve this.",

This paper re-examines the experiment\nresults according to the available statistical guidelines for interpreting\nkappa values, by showing that the degree of agreement, always in the range\n0.09-0.42 has to be interpreted, for all research fields, as unacceptable, poor\nor, in a few cases, as, at most, fair.

We show that the experiment protocol\nadopted in Area 13 was substantially modified with respect to all the other\nresearch fields, to the point that results for economics and statistics have to\nbe considered as fatally flawed. The evidence of a poor agreement supports the\nconclusion that IR and bibliometrics do not produce similar results, and that\nthe adoption of both methods in the Italian research assessment possibly\nintroduced systematic and unknown biases in its final results.

The subjects belong to two\ndifferent groups, formed by four and eight subjects with, respectively, high-\nand low-amplitude rest tremors. Each subject is tested in four settings, given\nby combining the use of deep brain stimulation and L-DOPA medication. We\ndevelop two main feature-based representations of such signals, which are\nobtained by considering (i) the long-term correlations and multifractal\nproperties, and (ii) the power spectra. The feature-based representations are\ninitially utilized for the purpose of characterizing the subjects under\ndifferent settings. In agreement with previous studies, we show that deep brain\nstimulation does not significantly characterize neither of the two groups,\nregardless of the adopted representation. On the other hand, the medication\neffect yields statistically significant differences in both high- and\nlow-amplitude tremor groups. We successively test several different instances\nof the two feature-based representations of the signals in the setting of\nsupervised classification and (nonlinear) feature transformation. We consider\nthree different classification problems, involving the recognition of (i) the\npresence of medication, (ii) the use of deep brain stimulation, and (iii) the\nmembership to the high- and low-amplitude tremor groups. Classification results\nshow that the use of medication can be discriminated with higher accuracy,\nconsidering many of the feature-based representations.

We apply this framework to a massive dataset of news articles\nspanning the six years of Obama's presidency and all of his speeches, and\nreveal that a systematic pattern does indeed emerge from the outlet's quoting\nbehavior. Moreover, we show that this pattern can be successfully exploited in\nan unsupervised prediction setting, to determine which new quotes an outlet\nwill select to broadcast. By encoding bias patterns in a low-rank space we\nprovide an analysis of the structure of political media coverage. This reveals\na latent media bias space that aligns surprisingly well with political ideology\nand outlet type. A linguistic analysis exposes striking differences across\nthese latent dimensions, showing how the different types of media outlets\nportray different realities even when reporting on the same events. For\nexample, outlets mapped to the mainstream conservative side of the latent space\nfocus on quotes that portray a presidential persona disproportionately\ncharacterized by negativity.",

First,\nthey guarantee by construction a good conditioning of the estimate and second,\nbeing a derivative of robust Tyler estimators, they inherit their robustness\nproperties, notably their resilience to the presence of outliers. Nevertheless,\none major problem that poses the use of RTEs in practice is represented by the\nquestion of setting the regularization parameter $\\rho$. While a high value of\n$\\rho$ is likely to push all the eigenvalues away from zero, it comes at the\ncost of a larger bias with respect to the population covariance matrix. A deep\nunderstanding of the statistics of RTEs is essential to come up with\nappropriate choices for the regularization parameter. This is not an easy task\nand might be out of reach, unless one considers asymptotic regimes wherein the\nnumber of observations $n$ and/or their size $N$ increase together. First\nasymptotic results have recently been obtained under the assumption that $N$\nand $n$ are large and commensurable. Interestingly, no results concerning the\nregime of $n$ going to infinity with $N$ fixed exist, even though the\ninvestigation of this assumption has usually predated the analysis of the most\ndifficult $N$ and $n$ large case. This motivates our work. In particular, we\nprove in the present paper that the RTEs converge to a deterministic matrix\nwhen $n\\to\\infty$ with $N$ fixed, which is expressed as a function of the\ntheoretical covariance matrix. We also derive the fluctuations of the RTEs\naround this deterministic matrix and establish that these fluctuations converge\nin distribution to a multivariate Gaussian distribution with zero mean and a\ncovariance depending on the population covariance and the parameter $\\rho$.",

    "abstract": "In a multicore system, applications running on different cores interfere at\nmain memory. This inter-application interference degrades overall system\nperformance and unfairly slows down applications. Prior works have developed\napplication-aware memory schedulers to tackle this problem. State-of-the-art\napplication-aware memory schedulers prioritize requests of applications that\nare vulnerable to interference, by ranking individual applications based on\ntheir memory access characteristics and enforcing a total rank order.\n  In this paper, we observe that state-of-the-art application-aware memory\nschedulers have two major shortcomings. First, such schedulers trade off\nhardware complexity in order to achieve high performance or fairness, since\nranking applications with a total order leads to high hardware complexity.\nSecond, ranking can unfairly slow down applications that are at the bottom of\nthe ranking stack. To overcome these shortcomings, we propose the Blacklisting\nMemory Scheduler (BLISS), which achieves high system performance and fairness\nwhile incurring low hardware complexity, based on two observations. First, we\nfind that, to mitigate interference, it is sufficient to separate applications\ninto only two groups. Second, we show that this grouping can be efficiently\nperformed by simply counting the number of consecutive requests served from\neach application.\n  We evaluate BLISS across a wide variety of workloads/system configurations\nand compare its performance and hardware complexity, with five state-of-the-art\nmemory schedulers. Our evaluations show that BLISS achieves 5% better system\nperformance and 25% better fairness than the best-performing previous scheduler\nwhile greatly reducing critical path latency and hardware area cost of the\nmemory scheduler (by 79% and 43%, respectively), thereby achieving a good\ntrade-off between performance, fairness and hardware complexity.",

Two seemingly contrasting categories of cues have been proposed to\ninfluence where people look: \\textit{low-level image saliency} and\n\\textit{high-level semantic information}. Our first contribution is to take a\ndetailed look at these cues to confirm the hypothesis proposed by\nHenderson~\\cite{henderson1993eye} and Nuthmann \\&\nHenderson~\\cite{nuthmann2010object} that observers tend to look at the center\nof objects. We analyzed fixation data for scene free-viewing over 17 observers\non 60 fully annotated images with various types of objects. Images contained\ndifferent types of scenes, such as natural scenes, line drawings, and 3D\nrendered scenes. Our second contribution is to propose a simple combined model\nof low-level saliency and object center-bias that outperforms each individual\ncomponent significantly over our data, as well as on the OSIE dataset by Xu et\nal.~\\cite{xu2014predicting}. The results reconcile saliency with object\ncenter-bias hypotheses and highlight that both types of cues are important in\nguiding fixations. Our work opens new directions to understand strategies that\nhumans use in observing scenes and objects, and demonstrates the construction\nof combined models of low-level saliency and high-level object-based\ninformation.",

Recent\nfindings by Landman et al. indicate that aggregation is likely to inflate the\ncorrelation between size and complexity metrics. In this paper, we explore the\neffect of nine aggregation techniques on the correlation between three types of\ncode metrics, namely Lines of Code, McCabe, and Halstead metrics. In addition\nto summation, we study aggregation techniques that are measures of: (1) central\ntendency (average and median), (2) dispersion (standard deviation and\ninter-quartile range), (3) shape (skewness and kurtosis), and (4) income\ninequality (Theil index and Gini coefficient). Our results show that defect\nprediction models built using summation outperform those built using other\naggregation techniques. We also find that more complex aggregations are no\ndifferent than much simpler ones and that incorporating all aggregation types\nin the same model does not provide a significant improvement over using\nsummation alone.",

Even the most powerful convolutional neural network we can train fails\nto perform satisfactorily when trained and tested on data from different\ndatabases. This issue, known as domain adaptation and/or dataset bias in the\nliterature, is due to a distribution mismatch between data collections. Methods\naddressing it go from max-margin classifiers to learning how to modify the\nfeatures and obtain a more robust representation. Recent work showed that by\ncasting the problem into the image-to-class recognition framework, the domain\nadaptation problem is significantly alleviated \\cite{danbnn}. Here we follow\nthis approach, and show how a very simple, learning free Naive Bayes Nearest\nNeighbor (NBNN)-based domain adaptation algorithm can significantly alleviate\nthe distribution mismatch among source and target data, especially when the\nnumber of classes and the number of sources grow. Experiments on standard\nbenchmarks used in the literature show that our approach (a) is competitive\nwith the current state of the art on small scale problems, and (b) achieves the\ncurrent state of the art as the number of classes and sources grows, with\nminimal computational requirements.",

Most importantly, in\naddition to the geographical coordinates of the user's location, LBSNs allow\neasy access to an additional set of characteristics of that location, such as\nthe venue type or popularity.\n  In this paper, we investigate the role of location semantics in the\nidentification of LBSN users. We simulate a scenario in which the attacker's\ngoal is to reveal the identity of a set of LBSN users by observing their\ncheck-in activity. We then propose to answer the following question: what are\nthe types of venues that a malicious user has to monitor to maximize the\nprobability of success? Conversely, when should a user decide whether to make\nhis/her check-in to a location public or not? We perform our study on more than\n1 million check-ins distributed over 17 urban regions of the United States. Our\nanalysis shows that different types of venues display different discriminative\npower in terms of user identity, with most of the venues in the \"Residence\"\ncategory providing the highest re-identification success across the urban\nregions. Interestingly, we also find that users with a high entropy of their\ncheck-ins distribution are not necessarily the hardest to identify, suggesting\nthat it is the collective behaviour of the users' population that determines\nthe complexity of the identification task, rather than the individual\nbehaviour.",

    "abstract": "With the rich set of embedded sensors installed in smartphones and the large\nnumber of mobile users, we witness the emergence of many innovative commercial\nmobile crowdsensing applications that combine the power of mobile technology\nwith crowdsourcing to deliver time-sensitive and location-dependent information\nto their customers. Motivated by these real-world applications, we consider the\ntask selection problem for heterogeneous users with different initial\nlocations, movement costs, movement speeds, and reputation levels. Computing\nthe social surplus maximization task allocation turns out to be an NP-hard\nproblem. Hence we focus on the distributed case, and propose an asynchronous\nand distributed task selection (ADTS) algorithm to help the users plan their\ntask selections on their own. We prove the convergence of the algorithm, and\nfurther characterize the computation time for users' updates in the algorithm.\nSimulation results suggest that the ADTS scheme achieves the highest Jain's\nfairness index and coverage comparing with several benchmark algorithms, while\nyielding similar user payoff to a greedy centralized benchmark. Finally, we\nillustrate how mobile users coordinate under the ADTS scheme based on some\npractical movement time data derived from Google Maps.",

    "abstract": "Sampling hidden populations is particularly challenging using standard\nsampling methods mainly because of the lack of a sampling frame.\nRespondent-driven sampling (RDS) is an alternative methodology that exploits\nthe social contacts between peers to reach and weight individuals in these\nhard-to-reach populations. It is a snowball sampling procedure where the weight\nof the respondents is adjusted for the likelihood of being sampled due to\ndifferences in the number of contacts. In RDS, the structure of the social\ncontacts thus defines the sampling process and affects its coverage, for\ninstance by constraining the sampling within a sub-region of the network. In\nthis paper we study the bias induced by network structures such as social\ntriangles, community structure, and heterogeneities in the number of contacts,\nin the recruitment trees and in the RDS estimator. We simulate different\nscenarios of network structures and response-rates to study the potential\nbiases one may expect in real settings. We find that the prevalence of the\nestimated variable is associated with the size of the network community to\nwhich the individual belongs. Furthermore, we observe that low-degree nodes may\nbe under-sampled in certain situations if the sample and the network are of\nsimilar size. Finally, we also show that low response-rates lead to reasonably\naccurate average estimates of the prevalence but generate relatively large\nbiases.",

This setting, known as contextual\nbandits, encompasses a wide variety of applications such as health care,\ncontent recommendation and Internet advertising. A central task is evaluation\nof a new policy given historic data consisting of contexts, actions and\nreceived rewards. The key challenge is that the past data typically does not\nfaithfully represent proportions of actions taken by a new policy. Previous\napproaches rely either on models of rewards or models of the past policy. The\nformer are plagued by a large bias whereas the latter have a large variance. In\nthis work, we leverage the strengths and overcome the weaknesses of the two\napproaches by applying the doubly robust estimation technique to the problems\nof policy evaluation and optimization. We prove that this approach yields\naccurate value estimates when we have either a good (but not necessarily\nconsistent) model of rewards or a good (but not necessarily consistent) model\nof past policy. Extensive empirical comparison demonstrates that the doubly\nrobust estimation uniformly improves over existing techniques, achieving both\nlower variance in value estimation and better policies. As such, we expect the\ndoubly robust approach to become common practice in policy evaluation and\noptimization.",

In part this is due to the insight that this concept plays a\nfundamental role in many different fields, such as legal theory, engineering,\nmedicine, ethics, etc. Because of this diversity in applications, some\nresearchers have shifted focus from a single idealized definition towards a\nmore pragmatic, context-based account. For instance, recent work by Halpern and\nHitchcock draws on empirical research regarding people's causal judgments, to\nsuggest a graded and context-sensitive notion of causation. Although we\nsympathize with many of their observations, their restriction to a merely\nqualitative ordering runs into trouble for more complex examples. Therefore we\naim to improve on their approach, by using the formal language of CP-logic\n(Causal Probabilistic logic), and the framework for defining actual causation\nthat was developed by the current authors using it. First we rephrase their\nideas into our quantitative, probabilistic setting, after which we modify it to\naccommodate a greater class of examples.

In this paper, we propose a new\ndomain adaptation framework named Deep Transfer Network (DTN), where the highly\nflexible deep neural networks are used to implement such a distribution\nmatching process.\n  This is achieved by two types of layers in DTN: the shared feature extraction\nlayers which learn a shared feature subspace in which the marginal\ndistributions of the source and the target samples are drawn close, and the\ndiscrimination layers which match conditional distributions by classifier\ntransduction. We also show that DTN has a computation complexity linear to the\nnumber of training samples, making it suitable to large-scale problems. By\ncombining the best paradigms in both worlds (deep neural networks in\nrecognition, and matching marginal and conditional distributions in domain\nadaptation), we demonstrate by extensive experiments that DTN improves\nsignificantly over former methods in both execution time and classification\naccuracy.",

In its current form, the formulation of surprise is rather\ndifficult to analyze. We here therefore develop an accurate asymptotic\napproximation. This allows for the development of an efficient algorithm for\noptimizing surprise. Incidentally, this leads to a straightforward extension of\nsurprise to weighted graphs. Additionally, the approximation makes it possible\nto analyze surprise more closely and compare it to other methods, especially\nmodularity. We show that surprise is (nearly) unaffected by the well known\nresolution limit, a particular problem for modularity. However, surprise may\ntend to overestimate the number of communities, whereas they may be\nunderestimated by modularity. In short, surprise works well in the limit of\nmany small communities, whereas modularity works better in the limit of few\nlarge communities. In this sense, surprise is more discriminative than\nmodularity, and may find communities where modularity fails to discern any\nstructure.",

    "abstract": "Population protocols are networks of finite-state agents, interacting\nrandomly, and updating their states using simple rules. Despite their extreme\nsimplicity, these systems have been shown to cooperatively perform complex\ncomputational tasks, such as simulating register machines to compute standard\narithmetic functions. The election of a unique leader agent is a key\nrequirement in such computational constructions. Yet, the fastest currently\nknown population protocol for electing a leader only has linear stabilization\ntime, and, it has recently been shown that no population protocol using a\nconstant number of states per node may overcome this linear bound.\n  In this paper, we give the first population protocol for leader election with\npolylogarithmic stabilization time, using polylogarithmic memory states per\nnode. The protocol structure is quite simple: each node has an associated\nvalue, and is either a leader (still in contention) or a minion (following some\nleader). A leader keeps incrementing its value and \"defeats\" other leaders in\none-to-one interactions, and will drop from contention and become a minion if\nit meets a leader with higher value. Importantly, a leader also drops out if it\nmeets a minion with higher absolute value. While these rules are quite simple,\nthe proof that this algorithm achieves polylogarithmic stabilization time is\nnon-trivial. In particular, the argument combines careful use of concentration\ninequalities with anti-concentration bounds, showing that the leaders' values\nbecome spread apart as the execution progresses, which in turn implies that\nstraggling leaders get quickly eliminated. We complement our analysis with\nempirical results, showing that our protocol stabilizes extremely fast, even\nfor large network sizes.",

CS is known as an efficient scheduling method that can assign\ndifferent time fractions for users or, equivalently, satisfy different channel\naccess ratio (CAR) requirements of users while exploiting multi-user diversity.\nWe first mathematically analyze the throughput characteristics of CS in\narbitrary fading statistics and data rate functions. It is shown that the\nthroughput gain of CS increases as the CAR of a user decreases or the number of\nusers in a cell increases. For Nakagami-m fading channels, we obtain the\naverage throughput in closed-form and investigate the effects of the average\nsignal-to-noise ratio, the shape parameter m, and the CAR on the throughput\nperformance. In addition, we propose a threshold-based opportunistic feedback\ntechnique in order to reduce feedback overhead while satisfying the CAR\nrequirements of users. We prove that the average feedback overhead of the\nproposed technique is upper bounded by -ln(p), where p is the probability that\nno user satisfies the threshold condition in a cell. Finally, we adopt a novel\nfairness criterion, called qualitative fairness, which considers not only the\nquantity of the allocated resources to users but also the quality of the\nresources. It is observed that CS provides a better qualitative fairness than\nother scheduling algorithms designed for controlling CARs of users.",

In this paper, we obtain an asymptotically delay\noptimal control policy, which resembles the BP algorithm in basing resource\nallocation and routing on a backpressure calculation, but differs from the BP\nalgorithm in the form of the backpressure calculation employed. The difference\nsuggests a possible reason for the unsatisfactory delay performance of the BP\nalgorithm, i.e., the myopic nature of the BP control. Motivated by this new\nconnection, we introduce a new class of enhanced backpressure-based algorithms\nwhich incorporate a general queue-dependent bias function into the backpressure\nterm of the traditional BP algorithm to improve delay performance. These\nenhanced algorithms exploit queue state information beyond one hop. We prove\nthe throughput optimality and characterize the utility-delay tradeoff of the\nenhanced algorithms. We further focus on two specific distributed algorithms\nwithin this class, which have demonstrably improved delay performance as well\nas acceptable implementation complexity.",

Wikipedia, available in many languages, is one of the most\nvisited websites in the world and arguably one of the primary sources of\nknowledge on the Web. However, not everyone is contributing to Wikipedia from a\ndiversity point of view; several groups are severely underrepresented. One of\nthose groups is women, who make up approximately 16% of the current contributor\ncommunity, meaning that most of the content is written by men. In addition,\nalthough there are specific guidelines of verifiability, notability, and\nneutral point of view that must be adhered by Wikipedia content, these\nguidelines are supervised and enforced by men.\n  In this paper, we propose that gender bias is not about participation and\nrepresentation only, but also about characterization of women. We approach the\nanalysis of gender bias by defining a methodology for comparing the\ncharacterizations of men and women in biographies in three aspects: meta-data,\nlanguage, and network structure. Our results show that, indeed, there are\ndifferences in characterization and structure. Some of these differences are\nreflected from the off-line world documented by Wikipedia, but other\ndifferences can be attributed to gender bias in Wikipedia content. We\ncontextualize these differences in feminist theory and discuss their\nimplications for Wikipedia policy.",

    "abstract": "Crowdsourcing refers to the arrangement in which contributions are solicited\nfrom a large group of unrelated people. Due to this nature, crowdsourcers (or\ntask requesters) often face uncertainty about the workers' capabilities which,\nin turn, affects the quality and timeliness of the results obtained. Trust is a\nmechanism used by people to facilitate interactions in human societies where\nrisk and uncertain are common. The crucial challenge to building a robust\ncrowdsourcing system is how to make trust-aware task delegation decisions to\nefficiently utilize the capacities of workers (or trustee agents) to achieve\nhigh social welfare?\n  This book presents the research addressing this challenge. It goes beyond the\nexisting trust management research framework by removing a widespread\nassumption implicitly adopted by existing research: that a trustee agent can\nprocess an unlimited number of interaction requests per discrete time unit\nwithout compromising its performance as perceived by the task requesters (or\ntruster agents). Decision support in crowdsourcing is re-formalized as a\nmulti-agent trust game based on the principles of the Congestion Game, which is\nsolved by two trust-aware interaction decision-making approaches: 1) the Social\nWelfare Optimizing approach for Reputation-aware Decision-making (SWORD)\napproach, and 2) the Distributed Request Acceptance approach for Fair\nutilization of Trustee agents (DRAFT). SWORD is designed for centralized\nsystems, while DRAFT is designed for fully distributed systems. Theoretical\nanalyses have shown that the social welfare produced by these two approaches\ncan be made closer to optimal by adjusting only one key parameter. With these\ntwo approaches, the framework of research for crowdsourcing systems can be\nenriched to handle more realistic scenarios where workers have varied and\nlimited capabilities.",

Probabilistic models can\nlearn users' tastes from the history of their item adoptions and recommend new\nitems to users. However, current models ignore cognitive biases that are known\nto affect behavior. Specifically, people pay more attention to items at the top\nof a list than those in lower positions. As a consequence, items near the top\nof a user's social media stream have higher visibility, and are more likely to\nbe seen and adopted, than those appearing below. Another bias is due to the\nitem's fitness: some items have a high propensity to spread upon exposure\nregardless of the interests of adopting users. We propose a probabilistic model\nthat incorporates human cognitive biases and personal relevance in the\ngenerative model of information spread.

Here, we model the\nmax-flow and proportional fairness protocols for the control of congestion\ncaused by a fleet of vehicles charging on two real-world distribution networks.\nWe show that the system undergoes a continuous phase transition to a congested\nstate as a function of the rate of vehicles plugging to the network to charge.\nWe focus on the order parameter and its fluctuations close to the phase\ntransition, and show that the critical point depends on the choice of\ncongestion protocol. Finally, we analyse the inequality in the charging times\nas the vehicle arrival rate increases, and show that charging times are\nconsiderably more equitable in proportional fairness than in max-flow.",

Data incest (misinformation\npropagation) occurs due to unintentional re-use of identical actions in the\nfor- mation of public belief in social learning; the information gathered by\neach agent is mistakenly considered to be independent. This results in\noverconfidence and bias in estimates of the state. Necessary and sufficient\nconditions are given on the structure of information exchange graph to mitigate\ndata incest. Incest removal algorithms are presented. Experimental results on\nhuman subjects are presented to illustrate the effect of social influence and\ndata incest on decision making. These experimental results indicate that social\nlearning protocols require careful design to handle and mitigate data incest.\nThe incest removal algorithms are illustrated in an expectation polling system\nwhere participants in a poll respond with a summary of their friends' beliefs.\nFinally, the principle of revealed preferences arising in micro-economics\ntheory is used to parse Twitter datasets to determine if social sensors are\nutility maximizers and then determine their utility functions.",
